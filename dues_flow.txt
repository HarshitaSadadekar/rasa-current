Bot - Make Sure to discuss your concern with your bank to find out an appropriate solution.There are alternative solutions like Personal loan  or other repayment mechanisms where you repay the outstanding amount as monthly EMIs. 
User - okay , thank you

Bot- get in touch with your bank to pay off the outstanding bill amount immediately. You can also request the bank representative to reverse the late-fees. Banks try to reverse the late-fee charges for one-time delays.
